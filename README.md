# Heart-Rate-monitor-Project
Heart rate,blood pressure are the very important parameters of  human body.
Doctors use various parameters for checking blood pressure and pulse count.
We have designed a arduino based heart beat sensor module.
It is a wireless device that monitors the heart rate and  pulse count and display it on LCD digitally  using arduino.
The pulse of the heart is taken from tip of the finger.
